      <p class="cs-lead">When a SaaS company outgrows its informal approach to people management, the cost of doing nothing becomes higher than the cost of building it right. This engagement covers what a full HR infrastructure build looks like — from audit to handoff — over a 9 to 12 month fractional engagement.</p>

          <h2>The CEO was the HR department. That stopped working around employee 40.</h2>
          <p>The company had been operating without a formal HR function for its entire existence. In the early days, that was fine — the team was small, everyone knew each other, and the founder handled people questions directly. But at 75 employees across three states, the cracks were showing everywhere at once.</p>
          <p>There was no employee handbook. Compensation decisions were made ad hoc, without a framework, which meant that similar roles in similar states were being paid differently for no defensible reason. There was no formal performance process — feedback happened informally, or not at all. The company was operating in California, New York, and Texas without any systematic approach to the different employment law requirements in each state.</p>
          <p>Two employment-related issues in the prior year had been handled without documentation, creating exposure that a formal process would have prevented. The CEO had spent an estimated 20% of his time fielding people questions that should have had clear answers — and didn't.</p>
          <p>The company didn't need a consultant to tell them they had a problem. They needed someone to come in, assess the full scope of it, prioritize what mattered most, and build what was missing — in the right order, at a pace the organization could absorb.</p>

      <h2>A 9 to 12 month roadmap — built to sequence correctly.</h2>
      <p style="color: var(--muted); max-width: 640px; margin-bottom: 56px;">Order matters in this kind of work. Building a performance process before you have a comp framework creates confusion. Rolling out a handbook before you've addressed compliance gaps puts the wrong things in writing. The roadmap below reflects the sequencing logic that makes a full HR build sustainable rather than just complete.</p>

          <h2>An organization with a real HR function — and the capability to sustain it.</h2>
          <p>By the close of the engagement, the company had moved from no HR infrastructure to a fully operational people function. The handbook was live and acknowledged. The compensation framework had already been used to correct three pay equity gaps identified during the audit. The HRIS was configured and in active use. Managers were operating with clear expectations and functional tools.</p>
          <p>The CEO's time spent on people questions dropped significantly. More importantly, the questions being escalated to him were the ones that actually warranted his attention — not the ones that should have had a clear answer in the handbook or the comp framework.</p>
          <p>The incoming HR Manager, hired in month 10, had a full handoff — documented processes, live systems, organizational context, and a defined first-90-days plan. The organization didn't lose momentum in the transition because everything was built to be handed over from the start.</p>
