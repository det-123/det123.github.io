          <p>Dominique writes about the HR challenges that do not have easy answers, the ones that keep you up at night because every option has trade offs. Her insights are grounded in what actually works when you are balancing compliance requirements, protecting your culture, and hitting business goals. She tackles the messy intersections: when legal says one thing and your values say another, when scaling fast conflicts with getting it right, when stakeholder interests do not align. Expect practical perspectives drawn from advising hundreds of companies, not generic best practices that ignore your reality.</p>
