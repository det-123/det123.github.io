        <h2>Talent Management and Performance Systems</h2>
        <div class="hr"></div>
        <div class="kicker">The challenge</div>
        <p>Most performance management systems fail because they are either too complex to sustain or too vague to drive real accountability, leaving managers without tools to differentiate performance, develop talent, or make defensible termination decisions.</p>
        <div class="kicker">Approach</div>
        <p>I build performance systems, succession planning frameworks, and compensation structures that align talent decisions with business strategy and create clear expectations at every level. My approach focuses on systems that managers will actually use and that produce documentation capable of withstanding legal scrutiny when difficult employment decisions are necessary.</p>
        <div class="kicker">Outcomes</div>
        <p>Organizations gain clarity on their talent bench strength, increase manager effectiveness in having difficult conversations, and make promotion and compensation decisions backed by data rather than politics.</p>

        <h2>HR Compliance and Risk Management</h2>
        <div class="hr"></div>
        <div class="kicker">The challenge</div>
        <p>Organizations operating across multiple states face a constantly shifting landscape of federal, state, and local employment laws, where a single misstep in classification, wage and hour practices, or leave administration can trigger audits, penalties, and litigation that cost six figures or more.</p>
        <div class="kicker">Approach</div>
        <p>I design audit ready compliance frameworks tailored to your operational reality, identifying exposure areas before they become problems and building systems that embed compliance into everyday workflows rather than treating it as a separate function. My approach prioritizes sustainable solutions that your team can actually maintain without requiring a compliance officer in every decision.</p>
        <div class="kicker">Outcomes</div>
        <p>Clients gain confidence that their HR practices will withstand regulatory scrutiny, reduce legal risk exposure by 40 to 60 percent, and avoid costly remediation during M and A due diligence or government audits.</p>

        <h2>Training and Development</h2>
        <div class="hr"></div>
        <div class="kicker">The challenge</div>
        <p>Manager effectiveness training often falls flat because it is too theoretical, does not address the actual dilemmas managers face, or fails to provide tools they can apply immediately when employee issues arise.</p>
        <div class="kicker">Approach</div>
        <p>I design and deliver practical training programs grounded in real scenarios your managers encounter: difficult conversations, performance documentation, recognizing accommodation requests, de escalating conflict. My programs focus on judgment development and risk awareness, not just policy recitation, and include decision frameworks managers can reference after training ends.</p>
        <div class="kicker">Outcomes</div>
        <p>Organizations see 30 to 50 percent reductions in employee relations escalations, improved quality of performance documentation, and increased manager confidence in handling sensitive situations before they become HR or legal problems.</p>

        <h2>Employee Relations and Workplace Investigations</h2>
        <div class="hr"></div>
        <div class="kicker">The challenge</div>
        <p>Sensitive workplace matters, harassment allegations, discrimination claims, performance disputes involving protected classes, carry significant legal, financial, and reputational risk, and most organizations lack the expertise to navigate them without creating additional liability or damaging culture.</p>
        <div class="kicker">Approach</div>
        <p>I conduct thorough, impartial investigations that meet legal standards while protecting confidentiality and organizational trust. I help leadership teams respond decisively to complex employee relations issues, distinguishing between legitimate concerns and tactical complaints, and implementing preventive strategies that address root causes rather than symptoms.</p>
        <div class="kicker">Outcomes</div>
        <p>Organizations resolve sensitive matters with minimal legal exposure, preserve workplace culture and employee confidence, and significantly reduce repeat incidents through targeted interventions.</p>

        <h2>Leave of Absence Administration</h2>
        <div class="hr"></div>
        <div class="kicker">The challenge</div>
        <p>Leave administration under FMLA, ADA, state specific laws, and company policies is one of the highest risk areas in HR, where errors in designation, duration, or interactive process create immediate compliance violations and discrimination claims.</p>
        <div class="kicker">Approach</div>
        <p>I build comprehensive leave administration programs that ensure multi jurisdictional compliance while treating employees with dignity during medical crises, family emergencies, and disability accommodations. My systems clarify designation authority, track concurrent leave entitlements, document interactive processes, and integrate with benefits and payroll to prevent errors.</p>
        <div class="kicker">Outcomes</div>
        <p>Organizations eliminate leave related EEOC complaints, reduce administrative errors by 80 percent plus, and gain confidence that their leave practices will withstand DOL or state agency audits.</p>
