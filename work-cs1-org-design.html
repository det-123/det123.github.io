          <h2>Growth without structure is just chaos at scale.</h2>
          <p>The agency had done everything right on the business side. Client wins led to headcount additions, which led to more wins. In 18 months, the team grew from 28 to 60 people. But the people infrastructure never kept pace.</p>
          <p>Roles had been created to fill immediate needs, not to build lasting structure. A "Senior Strategist" at one point in the org did something entirely different from a "Senior Strategist" hired six months later. Managers were managing 12 or more direct reports with no consistency in how they evaluated performance, gave feedback, or made compensation decisions. The founding partners were still the de facto decision-makers on every significant people question — a dynamic that worked at 20 people and broke down entirely at 60.</p>
          <p>The breaking point came when a highly regarded creative director resigned. In her exit conversation, she said she had no idea what growth looked like for her at the company, didn't know how her performance was evaluated, and felt that her role had been quietly expanded without acknowledgment or adjustment. She wasn't wrong on any count.</p>
          <p>Leadership recognized this wasn't an isolated retention problem. It was a structural one.</p>

          <div class="cs-phase-body">
            <h3>Organizational assessment and gap analysis</h3>
            <p>The engagement began with a structured discovery — interviews with senior leaders and a representative sample of employees, a review of all current job descriptions, and an audit of how decisions were actually being made versus how leadership thought they were being made. The gap between those two things was significant.</p>
            <p>The assessment surfaced three core problems: role definition was inconsistent across similar functions, accountability was concentrated in too few people at the top, and there was no shared language for what "good" looked like at any level of the organization.</p>

          <div class="cs-phase-body">
            <h3>Role definition and job architecture</h3>
            <p>Working with functional leads, every role in the organization was reviewed, clarified, and placed within a consistent job architecture. Levels were defined — not just titles — with clear criteria distinguishing a mid-level contributor from a senior one, and a senior individual contributor from a manager. Compensation bands were mapped to the architecture, creating a defensible and consistent foundation for pay decisions.</p>
            <p>This work also surfaced several employees who had been operating at a level above their official title for an extended period. Addressing those gaps was a critical part of the rollout.</p>

          <div class="cs-phase-body">
            <h3>Spans of control and reporting structure redesign</h3>
            <p>The reporting structure was redesigned to distribute accountability more evenly and give managers a realistic number of direct reports — defined based on role complexity and the level of coaching each function required. Several senior leaders who had been managing large, mixed-level teams were restructured into more focused spans, with a new layer of team leads created to carry day-to-day management for individual contributor groups.</p>

            <h3>Performance framework</h3>
            <p>A lightweight but rigorous performance framework was designed for the agency's operating rhythm — quarterly check-ins built around three questions: what's working, what needs to change, and what does development look like for this person right now. Annual reviews were restructured around the job architecture, so that feedback was anchored to defined expectations rather than manager intuition.</p>
            <p>Calibration guidelines were developed so that compensation decisions — increases, promotions, bonuses — followed a consistent and explainable logic across the organization.</p>

            <h3>Career pathing and manager onboarding</h3>
            <p>For each functional track, a career pathing guide was developed — showing employees what growth looked like at every level, what skills and contributions distinguished one level from the next, and what the expected timeline was. These were not aspirational documents. They were grounded in the job architecture and written to be used in development conversations, not filed away.</p>
            <p>Each manager received a focused onboarding session on the new structure — their new spans, how to use the performance framework, and how to have the promotion and compensation conversations that had previously been avoided or inconsistently handled.</p>

          <div class="kicker">The Outcome</div>
          <h2>A structure the organization could hire into — and grow within.</h2>
          <p>The agency emerged from the engagement with a people infrastructure that reflected how the business actually operated. Roles were defined and defensible. Managers had reasonable spans and the tools to lead within them. Employees had a clear picture of where they stood and what growth looked like.</p>
          <p>Three employees whose titles had lagged their contributions were formally leveled up as part of the rollout — a signal that the new structure was being applied with integrity, not just on paper. Two open roles that had been stalled were filled within six weeks of the job architecture launch, in part because the hiring process could now articulate what the role was and what success looked like with clarity it hadn't had before.</p>
          <p>Perhaps most importantly, the founding partners were no longer the default answer to every people question. The structure distributed that accountability to the people best positioned to carry it.</p>
