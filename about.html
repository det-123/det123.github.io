        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Dominique E. Thomas brings that judgment through more than 15 years of senior level HR experience advising organizations at critical moments. Her career has been built in outsourced HR consulting, supporting growth stage companies and established enterprises across technology, professional services, healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services. Rather than refining HR for a single organization, she has built, scaled, and remediated HR systems for over a thousand companies supporting tens of thousands of employees across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
        <p>She understands exactly when organizations realize they need experienced HR leadership. It often surfaces during moments of pressure: preparing for acquisition while compliance gaps emerge, managing high risk employee relations matters, scaling beyond the limits of informal HR processes, or responding to legal challenges tied to misclassification, leave administration, or documentation failures. Dominique has managed hundreds of high risk employee relations cases annually and led HR transformations that reduced litigation exposure, increased operational efficiency, and strengthened leadership decision making.</p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>Her approach is deliberately different from standard consulting models. Dominique does not begin with HR best practices and attempt to force them into place. She starts with the organization’s reality: risk tolerance, culture, leadership capability, and operational constraints. Every recommendation is grounded in a risk weighted decision framework that makes trade offs explicit, allowing leaders to understand the cost, impact, and exposure associated with each option.</p>
        <p>Organizations facing genuine complexity need experienced HR counsel, not volume driven solutions or templated guidance. Dominique prioritizes depth, discretion, and strategic thinking, supporting leaders who need clarity when decisions carry real legal, financial, and cultural consequences.</p>
