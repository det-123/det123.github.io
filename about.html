        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Dominique E. Thomas brings more than 15 years of senior level experience supporting organizations through high consequence people and organizational decisions. Her work spans growth stage companies and established enterprises across technology, professional services, healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than focusing on a single function, Dominique has built, scaled, and remediated people systems across multi jurisdictional environments, supporting organizations responsible for thousands of employees. Her experience includes navigating moments of pressure where risk exposure increases, systems break down, or leadership judgment is tested.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is frequently engaged during periods of transition, regulatory scrutiny, or escalation, helping organizations strengthen people and policy systems, reduce exposure, and improve decision quality across leadership teams.

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Dominique’s approach begins with understanding context. She does not lead with best practices or templates. Instead, she assesses organizational risk, leadership capability, and operating constraints before shaping recommendations or execution plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her work is grounded in disciplined decision making. Tradeoffs are made explicit. Risk is surfaced early. Systems are designed to function in real conditions, not ideal ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach supports leaders who need clarity when decisions carry legal, financial, or cultural consequence and require judgment rather than volume driven solutions.
