            People who have worked with Dominique often describe the experience the same way: she sees the full picture, understands what is actually driving the problem, and brings a path forward that addresses both the immediate situation and the conditions that created it.

          <h2>Presence that settles a room. Thinking that moves it forward.</h2>
          <p style="color: var(--muted); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72;">Dominique brings a grounded presence to high-pressure situations - the kind that creates space for clearer thinking and better decisions. She is known for commanding attention without demanding it, and for approaching complex people situations with the composure that leaders need most when stakes are high.</p>
          <p style="color: var(--muted); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72;">What distinguishes her approach is the breadth of her consideration. She holds all stakeholders in view, especially employees, managers, executives, and the organization itself, and designs responses that account for each of them.</p>

      <p style="color: var(--muted); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72; max-width: 680px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Since 2024, Dominique has worked as an independent HR advisor, partnering with leadership teams across industries on organizational development, compliance, and people strategy. The decision to consult independently was deliberate — an opportunity to work with greater focus and depth, and to bring senior-level HR expertise directly to organizations navigating significant change or complexity.</p>

          <h2>A decade of senior leadership that made all of it possible.</h2>
          <p style="color: var(--muted); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72;">The range and precision of Dominique's work today was shaped by a decade in senior leadership at a national HR services organization — an environment that required advising across more than 1,100 client companies and 26,000 employees simultaneously, spanning industries, company sizes, and HR challenges of every kind.</p>
          <p style="color: var(--muted); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72;">She advanced from HR Manager to Director of HR Services to Senior Director of HR Training and Compliance — building and leading a team of 30+ HR professionals, serving as the internal authority on employment law and compliance, and developing the organization's training and development function from the ground up. That function contributed to a 75% reduction in departmental turnover and a 60% increase in internal promotions year over year.</p>
          <p style="color: var(--muted); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72; margin-bottom: 0;">In 2024, she transitioned to independent consulting to work with organizations at greater depth and focus. She is also open to the right full-time senior HR leadership opportunity.</p>
