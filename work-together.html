      <h1 class="headline">How we work together.</h1>

      <p class="subhead">
        Organizations engage me in different ways depending on the moment, the level of complexity, and the type of support required. Each model provides a different level of involvement, structure, and continuity.

    <div class="cards">

      <!-- AD HOC -->
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Ad Hoc Support</h3>

        <p>
          Targeted guidance for specific questions, decisions, or immediate challenges. This model is best suited for leaders who need experienced HR perspective on a defined issue without ongoing engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Support may include reviewing documentation, advising on employee relations matters, interpreting policy or compliance questions, or providing decision guidance in time sensitive situations.
        </p>

        <p class="small">
          Typical use cases: immediate employee issues, risk assessment, policy clarification, documentation review, or second opinion advisory.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- ADVISORY -->
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Advisory Engagement</h3>

        <p>
          Ongoing strategic partnership with leadership teams navigating growth, complexity, or transition. Advisory work provides continuity, context, and consistent senior level HR perspective across evolving business needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work alongside leaders to assess organizational dynamics, design people systems, support decision making, and provide guidance on risk, structure, and workforce strategy over time.
        </p>

        <p class="small">
          Typical use cases: executive partnership, organizational design, risk management, leadership decision support, and long term HR strategy.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- PROJECT BASED -->
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Project Based Work</h3>

        <p>
          Defined scope engagements focused on building or improving a specific system, process, or capability. Project work includes clear deliverables, timelines, and measurable outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Projects often involve designing new infrastructure, implementing programs, or addressing structural challenges that require focused execution.
        </p>

        <p class="small">
          Typical use cases: policy development, HR infrastructure design, training programs, investigations, compliance frameworks, or organizational initiatives.

        <h3>Not sure which model fits your situation?</h3>

        <p>
          Most engagements begin with a conversation to understand context, scope, and priorities. From there, we determine the most appropriate level of support.
